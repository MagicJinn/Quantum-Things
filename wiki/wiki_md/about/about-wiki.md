# About the Wiki

## What is the Wiki?

The Wiki is a carbon copy of the Random Things Wiki, with the original style and content, but with the goal of improving upon it. This wiki contains all the information about Random Things, as well as Quantum Things, but does not distinguish between the two. Though most info will be the same, any info on this wiki should be assumed to only be relevant to Quantum Things.

Notable changes include dark mode, a search bar, new pages for new features, or features that were missing from the original wiki.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the wiki, or have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/issues) on the GitHub repository. You can also direclty contribute by submitting a pull request, specifically to [the wiki_md folder](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/tree/main/wiki/wiki_md) (or the parent folder `wiki`, to make structural changes).

It is recommended to check out the formatting on other markdown pages of the wiki, to get a better idea of how to format your pages. Here are some cliff notes:

- Mod features should be uppercase. nature core should be Nature Core.
- Every header should have `---` after it.
- The page should not distinguish between Random Things and Quantum Things. All info should be relevant to Quantum Things only, and should not refer to things as having changed between the two. "Quantum Things added the ability to configure x" should be "x is configurable".
- Use `.webp` format, and attempt to keep the file size as small as possible without losing quality.
- Keep descriptions user-focused and gameplay-oriented. Avoid technical implementation details unless they're relevant to how players use the feature.
