# Water Walking Boots

## Description

---

Water Walking Boots allow you to… walk on water. Pressing shift disables this effect, allowing you to break through the surface and enter water. As armor they provide the same amount of protection as chain boots but they are indestructible. They can only be found in ocean chests which spawn in the treasure room of ocean monuments.

*They also allow you to “jump” out and back on top of the water.*
