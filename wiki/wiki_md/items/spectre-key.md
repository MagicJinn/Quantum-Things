# Spectre Key

## Description

---

The Spectre Key grants you access to your own private room. Using it for 5 seconds (Like a bow) will teleport you to a 16x16 block room that is 4 blocks tall. In the middle of the room you will find the Spectre Core, right clicking it with [Ectoplasm](ectoplasm) will increase the rooms height by 1 per Ectoplasm, up to the height limit. If you use the Spectre Key while in your room, or right click the spectre core with an empty hand, it will teleport you back to the position you came from.

You can place anything you want in your spectre cube, it will be easily accessible from anywhere using your key. You **cannot** access the rooms of other players unless you are in creative mode.
