# Spectre Key

## Description

---

The Spectre Key is your ticket to your own personal pocket dimension. Hold right-click for 5 seconds (like drawing a bow) to teleport into your Spectre Dimension. Once inside, you can use the key again to return to exactly where you came from in the overworld.

Your Spectre Dimension starts as a small room, but you can expand it using Ectoplasm on the Spectre Core. See the [Spectre Dimension](../other/spectre-dimension) page for more details about building and customizing your personal space.
