# Rez Stone

## Description

---

The Rez Stone is a rare treasure you might find in dungeon chests, abandoned mineshafts, or Nether fortresses. It's a resurrection item that can bring players or entities back to life.

How exactly it works depends on how you use it, but it's definitely valuable - these things are hard to come by and can save you from losing everything when things go wrong.
