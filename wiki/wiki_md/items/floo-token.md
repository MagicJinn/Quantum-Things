# Floo Token

## Description

---

The Floo Token is an item used to create temporary Floo Fireplaces. When dropped on the ground and allowed to age for a few seconds, it spawns a temporary Floo Fireplace entity that can be used for teleportation.

The token creates a temporary access point to the Floo Network, allowing players to quickly establish teleportation points without needing to set up permanent fireplaces. The temporary fireplace will disappear after use or after a certain time.
