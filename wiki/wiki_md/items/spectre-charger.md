# Spectre Charger

## Description

---

When toggled on by right clicking, Spectre Charger will transfer energy from your spectre energy buffer into any item in your inventory that can accept it. The amount of energy per tick each item gets increases with the tier.

- Normal: 1024 per Tick
- Redstone: 4096 per Tick
- Ender: 20480 per Tick

The Genesis Charger is creative only and basically charges the items as fast as possible for free, similar to the Genesis Coil. It has no crafting recipe, and cannot be found. It can be configured to transfer Infinite energy instead of generating it, acting as a higher tier regular charger.

Just like the [Spectre Coils](../blocks/spectre-coils), the energy per tick multiplier also affects Spectre Chargers, and can be changed in the config.
