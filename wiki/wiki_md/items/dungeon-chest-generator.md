# Dungeon Chest Generator

## Description

---

The Dungeon Chest Generator is an epic item that can create chests filled with loot from any loot table in the game. Right-click to cycle through all the available loot tables forward, or shift-right-click to go backwards. The item's name and tooltip will show you which loot table is currently selected.

To generate a chest, just right-click any block and it'll place a chest filled with loot from your selected table. You can also sneak and right-click (or just left-click) to cycle through tables without placing anything. This is incredibly powerful for testing, creative building, or when you need specific items from particular loot tables.
