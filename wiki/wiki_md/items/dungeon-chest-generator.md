## Description

The Dungeon Chest Generator is an epic rarity item that can generate chests filled with loot from any loot table in the game. Right-clicking cycles through available loot tables, and shift-right-clicking cycles backwards. The current loot table is displayed in the item's name and tooltip.

Right-clicking a block places a chest filled with loot from the selected loot table. Sneaking while right-clicking or left-clicking cycles through the available loot tables. This item is extremely powerful for testing, creative building, or obtaining specific loot types.
