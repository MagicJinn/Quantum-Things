# Glowing Mushrooms

## Description

---

Glowing Mushrooms are handy little light sources you can find growing in caves. They're super useful - you can use them as a replacement for glowstone in **all** brewing recipes, and they're also needed to craft [Luminous Powder](luminous-powder).

You can also plant Glowing Mushrooms to grow more. They work great in dark places like caves since they need low light to thrive. Plant them on grass, dirt, stone, or Fertilized Dirt, and they'll slowly spread to nearby spots over time. They give off light, so they're perfect for lighting up your underground bases while also looking nice.
