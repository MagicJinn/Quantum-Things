# Redstone Activator

## Description

---

The Redstone Activator is a handy tool for sending temporary redstone signals to blocks. It has three duration options: 2 ticks (super quick), 20 ticks (1 second), or 100 ticks (5 seconds). Right-click to cycle through the durations forward, or shift-right-click to go backwards.

To use it, just right-click any block and it'll send a full-strength redstone signal (strength 15) to that block for however long you've set it. The tooltip shows you which duration is currently selected. This is perfect for testing your redstone builds or triggering one-time events without having to set up permanent redstone wiring.
