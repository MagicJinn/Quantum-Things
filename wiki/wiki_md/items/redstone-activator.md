# Redstone Activator

## Description

---

The Redstone Activator temporarily powers blocks with redstone when you right click them. For example, doors open, TNT ignites, lamps / redstone turns on.

You can change the duration of the signal between 2 / 20 / 100 Ticks by (shift)-right clicking into the air with it.

The direction of the signal depends on the side the block was clicked on by the activator. For example, if using the activator on a repeater, the repeater will only be powered if clicked from the input side.
