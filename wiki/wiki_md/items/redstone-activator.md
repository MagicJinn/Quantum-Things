# Redstone Activator

## Description

---

The Redstone Activator is a tool that can send temporary redstone signals to blocks. It has three duration settings: 2 ticks, 20 ticks (1 second), and 100 ticks (5 seconds). Right-clicking cycles through durations forward, and shift-right-clicking cycles backwards.

Right-clicking a block with the activator sends a redstone signal of strength 15 to that block for the selected duration. The current duration is displayed in the item's tooltip. This is useful for testing redstone contraptions or triggering one-time events without needing permanent redstone setups.
