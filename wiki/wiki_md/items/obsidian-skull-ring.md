# Obsidian Skull Ring

## Description

---

The Obsidian Skull Ring is a Bauble (requires the Baubles mod) that you can wear in a ring slot. It gives you the same protection as the Obsidian Skull, helping you resist various hazards.

Think of it as a wearable version of the Obsidian Skull - you get all the same protective benefits without using up a valuable inventory slot. Just equip it in your Baubles ring slot and you're good to go.
