## Description

---

The Floo Pouch is a storage item that can hold up to 128 Floo Powder. It displays a durability bar showing how much powder is stored. Sneaking and right-clicking automatically fills the pouch from Floo Powder in your inventory.

The pouch is used to store Floo Powder for use with Floo Network systems. It provides a convenient way to carry large amounts of powder without taking up multiple inventory slots. The durability bar is green and shows the fill level of stored powder.
