# Bottle of Air

## Description

---

The Bottle of Air is a rare lifesaver that lets you breathe underwater. When you're running out of air or already underwater, just right-click with it and it'll gradually refill your air supply, keeping you from drowning.

You need to be in water or have low air (below 270) to use it. It gives you a steady stream of air over a short time, making it perfect for those long underwater building projects or exploring deep ocean monuments without constantly worrying about drowning.
