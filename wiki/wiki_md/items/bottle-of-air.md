# Bottle of Air

## Description

---

The Bottle of Air is a rare item that allows you to breathe underwater. Right-clicking while underwater or when your air is low will gradually restore your air supply, preventing drowning.

The bottle must be used while in water or when your air level is below 270. It provides a steady supply of air over a short period, making it essential for extended underwater exploration or construction projects.
