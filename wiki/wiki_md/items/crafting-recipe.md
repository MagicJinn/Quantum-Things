# Crafting Recipe

## Description

---

The Crafting Recipe is like a recipe card you can carry around. It stores a complete crafting recipe so you don't have to remember all the ingredients and where they go. Right-click it to open a menu where you can see the full recipe and use it.

You can save recipes directly from a crafting table, then take the recipe item with you wherever you go. Super handy for those complex recipes with lots of ingredients - no more guessing or looking things up every time you want to craft something!
