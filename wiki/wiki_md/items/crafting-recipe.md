# Crafting Recipe

## Description

---

The Crafting Recipe is an item that can store a complete crafting recipe. Right-clicking opens a GUI where you can view and use the stored recipe. The recipe item displays the name of the resulting item in its tooltip.

Crafting Recipes can be created by saving a recipe from a crafting table interface. They provide a convenient way to store and recall complex recipes without needing to remember all the ingredients and their positions.
