# Spectre Tools

## Description

---

Using [Ectoplasm](ectoplasm.html) you can craft Spectre versions of vanilla tools. All of these tools have higher durability & enchantability than their diamond counterpart. The Spectre Pickaxe / Axe / Shovel all increase your block range by 3 while holding them. The Spectre Sword is able to hurt Spirits so you don’t need to use potions to kill them anymore.
