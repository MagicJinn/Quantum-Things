# Imbue

## Description

---

Imbue is a consumable potion-like item that comes in several variants: Fire, Poison, Experience, Wither, and Collapse. Drinking an Imbue applies a corresponding effect to the player for an extended duration (40 minutes).

Each Imbue type provides a different effect:
- **Fire Imbue**: Grants fire-related effects
- **Poison Imbue**: Grants poison-related effects  
- **Experience Imbue**: Grants experience-related effects
- **Wither Imbue**: Grants wither-related effects
- **Collapse Imbue**: Grants collapse-related effects

Only one Imbue effect can be active at a time - drinking a new Imbue will replace any existing Imbue effect. The item is consumed when used and returns an empty glass bottle.
