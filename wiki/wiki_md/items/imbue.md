# Imbue

## Description

---

Imbue is like a super-powered potion that lasts way longer - 40 minutes! It comes in five different types, each giving you a special effect. Just drink it like any other potion, and you'll get the effect for a really long time.

You can choose from:
- **Fire Imbue**: Fire-related powers
- **Poison Imbue**: Poison-related abilities
- **Experience Imbue**: Experience-related bonuses
- **Wither Imbue**: Wither-related effects
- **Collapse Imbue**: Collapse-related powers

Keep in mind that you can only have one Imbue active at a time. If you drink a new one, it'll replace whatever effect you already have. When you use it, you get an empty glass bottle back, just like regular potions.
