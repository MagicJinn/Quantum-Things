# ID Card

## Description

---

The ID Card is an item used to identify specific players. Right-clicking with an ID Card stores your player information (UUID and name) in the card. The card can then be used with various blocks and items that require player identification.

ID Cards are essential for systems like the Global Chat Detector's consuming mode, where they verify the identity of players sending messages. The card displays the player's name in its tooltip and can be used as a filter in various player-based systems.
