# ID Card

## Description

---

The ID Card is like a player ID badge. Right-click with it to store your player information in the card. Once it's set up, you can use it with various blocks and systems that need to know who you are.

These cards are really important for things like the Global Chat Detector's consuming mode - when someone sends a message, the system needs their ID Card to verify who they are before hiding the message. The card shows the player's name in its tooltip, and you can use it as a filter in any system that needs to identify specific players.
