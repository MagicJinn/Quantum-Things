# Floo Sign

## Description

---

The Floo Sign is used to create Floo Fireplaces for the Floo Network teleportation system. Right-click a brick block with a Floo Sign to convert it and connected brick blocks into a Floo Fireplace. The sign can be renamed in an anvil to give the fireplace a custom name.

When used, the Floo Sign scans for connected brick blocks (up to 20 blocks) and converts them into a Floo Fireplace network. The fireplace can then be accessed using Floo Tokens or other Floo Network items. The sign is consumed when creating a fireplace.
