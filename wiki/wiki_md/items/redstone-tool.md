# Redstone Tool

## Description

---

The Redstone Tool lets you connect Redstone Interfaces and Redstone Observers together wirelessly. Right-click one of these blocks to enter linking mode - you'll see an enchantment glow when it's active. Then right-click another compatible block to create a connection between them.

This tool is perfect for building complex redstone systems that stretch across large areas. Instead of running redstone wire everywhere, you can just link blocks together and have one control or observe another from any distance. Super handy for those big automated builds!
