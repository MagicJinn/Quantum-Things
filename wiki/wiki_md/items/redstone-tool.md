# Redstone Tool

## Description

---

The Redstone Tool is used to link Redstone Interfaces and Redstone Observers together. Right-clicking a Redstone Interface or Redstone Observer enters linking mode, indicated by an enchantment glow. Right-clicking another compatible block while in linking mode creates a connection between them.

The tool allows you to set up remote redstone connections where one block can control or observe another block from a distance. This is essential for creating complex redstone systems that span large areas without needing physical redstone wire connections.
