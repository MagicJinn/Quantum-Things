# Grass Seeds

## Description

---

Grass Seeds are used to convert dirt blocks into grass blocks. They come in multiple variants: normal grass seeds and colored grass seeds for each dye color. Right-clicking a dirt block with grass seeds converts it to the corresponding grass type.

Normal grass seeds create regular grass blocks, while colored grass seeds create Colored Grass blocks matching the seed's color. This provides an easy way to create custom grass-covered areas with specific color schemes.
