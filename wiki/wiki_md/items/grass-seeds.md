# Grass Seeds

## Description

---

Grass Seeds let you turn plain dirt into grass instantly. They come in regular green and colored versions for each dye color. Just right-click a dirt block with the seeds and watch it transform into grass.

Regular grass seeds make normal grass blocks, while the colored ones create Colored Grass that matches the seed's color. This makes it super easy to create custom grass-covered areas with whatever color scheme you want - perfect for themed builds or making your base stand out.
