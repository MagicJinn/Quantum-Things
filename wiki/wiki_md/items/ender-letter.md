# Ender Letter

## Description

---

The Ender Letter can be used to send other players items and messages across the server.

Right-clicking with an Ender Letter in your hand opens a GUI where you can add items to the letter and specify the receiver. To send a letter, shift right-click on any [Ender Mailbox](../blocks/ender-mailbox) with the addressed letter. The letter will be delivered to that player's mailbox inventory. You can only remove items from a received Ender Letter. Once the letter is empty, it will vanish.
