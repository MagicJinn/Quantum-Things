# Reinforced Ender Bucket

## Description

---

The Reinforced Ender Bucket is the big brother of the Ender Bucket - it can hold 10 times more fluid! While a regular Ender Bucket holds 1,000 mB (one bucket), this one holds 10,000 mB (ten buckets worth). Perfect for those big fluid-moving projects.

It works just like the regular Ender Bucket but better. The durability bar changes color to match whatever fluid you've got stored - blue for water, orange for lava, and so on. When you're sneaking and right-click a fluid source, it'll grab the entire connected body of fluid at once instead of stopping after one block. This makes it super efficient for draining lakes or collecting huge amounts of fluid quickly. Right-click to place the stored fluid, and the tooltip will show you what's inside.
