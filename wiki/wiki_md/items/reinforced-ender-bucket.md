# Reinforced Ender Bucket

## Description

---

The Reinforced Ender Bucket is an upgraded version of the Ender Bucket with a much larger capacity. It can hold up to 10,000 mB of fluid (10 buckets worth) compared to the standard Ender Bucket's 1,000 mB capacity.

The bucket can store any fluid and displays a durability bar that changes color based on the contained fluid. When sneaking, you can collect entire connected fluid sources at once, making it extremely efficient for large-scale fluid collection. Right-clicking places the stored fluid, and the bucket shows the fluid name in its tooltip when filled.
