# Item Collector

## Description

---

The Item Collector works like a hopper, but it can grab items from a distance instead of just from above. Place it on any inventory block (like a chest or furnace) and it will automatically collect any items that drop within 3 blocks of it. Just shift-click to place it on the inventory where you want items to go.

The Advanced Item Collector is the upgraded version that gives you much more control. You can set the collection range anywhere from 0 to 10 blocks in each direction, so you can make it grab items from a wide area or keep it tight. You can also add an [Item Filter](../items/item-filter) to tell it exactly which items to pick up and which to ignore. Right-click the Advanced Item Collector to open its configuration menu where you can adjust the range and set up your filters.
