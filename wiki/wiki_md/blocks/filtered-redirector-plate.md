# Filtered Redirector Plate

## Description

---

The Filtered Redirector Plate is a thin plate that redirects entities based on item filters. Right-clicking opens a GUI where you can configure two filters. Entities matching the first filter are redirected to the left, while entities matching the second filter are redirected to the right.

The plate has a configured input direction, and entities entering from that direction are checked against the filters. This allows for sophisticated item sorting systems where different items can be routed to different destinations based on their properties.
