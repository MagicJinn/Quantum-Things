# Ender Anchor

## Description

---

The Ender Anchor is the destination point for Ender Bridges. When an Ender Bridge receives a redstone signal, it searches for an Ender Anchor and teleports players within a 2 block radius to the anchor's location. The anchor must be placed with a clear line of air blocks between it and the bridge for teleportation to work.

Ender Anchors automatically load the chunk they are placed in, ensuring they can be found by bridges even in unloaded areas.
