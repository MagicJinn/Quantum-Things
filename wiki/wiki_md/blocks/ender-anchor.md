# Ender Anchor

## Description

---

The Ender Anchor is the destination point for [Ender Bridges](ender-bridge). It serves as the target location that Ender Bridges search for and teleport players to.

The Ender Anchor automatically keeps the chunk it's placed in loaded, ensuring that Ender Bridges can always find and teleport to it, even if the chunk would normally be unloaded. This makes it perfect for creating permanent teleportation networks across your world, as well as having an easy way to chunkload a chunk.
