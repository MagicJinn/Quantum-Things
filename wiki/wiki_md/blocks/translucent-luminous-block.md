# Translucent Luminous Block

## Description

---

The Translucent Luminous Block is a glowing, translucent building block that comes in all 16 dye colors. It emits light and allows light to pass through it, making it perfect for decorative lighting that doesn't block visibility.

Unlike the standard Luminous Block, this variant is fully translucent, allowing you to see through it while still providing illumination. It's ideal for creating stained glass-like effects with built-in lighting or for decorative builds where you want both transparency and glow.
