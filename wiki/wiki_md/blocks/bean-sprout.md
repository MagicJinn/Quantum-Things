# Bean Sprout

## Description

---

The Bean Sprout is a plant that grows from Beans planted on dirt or grass blocks. It goes through 8 growth stages before becoming fully mature. When fully grown, right-clicking the sprout harvests it and gives you 1-2 beans.

Bean Sprouts require adequate light to grow and can be bonemealed to accelerate growth. They are the primary way to farm beans, which can be used for food, crafting Bean Stew, or creating Magic Beans for growing Bean Stalks.
