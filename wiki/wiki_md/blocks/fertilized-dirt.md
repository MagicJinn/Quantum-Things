# Fertilized Dirt

## Description

---

Works pretty much the same as vanilla farmland, except it does not require any nearby water blocks, increases the growth of plants by a factor of 3 and crops are not destroyed when walking or jumping on the Fertilized Dirt like it sometimes happens with vanilla farmland.

Fertilized Dirt can be used as a Bonsai Pot soil in the Bonsai Trees mods, allowing you to grow bonsai trees on accelerated dirt. It is also properly recognized as farmland by villagers, so they can work on it just like regular farmland.
