# Global Chat Detector

## Description

---

The Global Chat Detector is an enhanced version of the Chat Detector that monitors chat messages from all players, not just the player who placed it. When a configured chat message is detected, it outputs a redstone signal.

The Global Chat Detector can operate in two modes: normal mode, where detected messages still appear in chat, and consuming mode, where messages are hidden from chat. For consuming mode to work, an ID Card of the player who typed the message is required.
