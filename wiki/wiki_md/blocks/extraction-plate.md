# Extraction Plate

## Description

---

The Extraction Plate is a thin plate that extracts items from the block below it and redirects them in a configured direction. Right-clicking opens a GUI to configure extraction filters, and shift-right-clicking the top changes the output direction.

The plate pulls items from inventories below it based on configured filters and ejects them in the selected direction. This makes it ideal for automated item extraction and routing systems where you need to pull specific items from storage and send them in a particular direction.
