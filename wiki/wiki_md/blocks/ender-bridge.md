# Ender Bridge

## Description

---

The Ender Bridge allows you to teleport across your world with no distance limit. The only requirement is a line of air blocks between the Ender Bridge and an [Ender Anchor](ender-anchor). However, the teleportation is not instant. The normal Ender Bridge takes 5 seconds to teleport you across 100 blocks ("Scans" 20 blocks per second). The Prismarine Ender Bridge is much faster and would only take half a second for the same distance ("Scans" 200 Blocks per second).

When powered by a redstone signal, Ender Bridges begin searching for an Ender Anchor in loaded chunks. Once found, all players within a 2 block radius are teleported to the Ender Anchor, after which the bridge enters a cooldown that lasts until it no longer receives a redstone signal. The block directly in front of the bridge is ignored during the search, allowing you to place a pressure plate on top without blocking upward-facing bridges.
