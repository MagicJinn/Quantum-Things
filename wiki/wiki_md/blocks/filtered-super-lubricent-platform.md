# Filtered Super Lubricent Platform

## Description

---

The Filtered Super Lubricent Platform is an advanced version of the Super Lubricent Platform that can be configured with item filters. Right-clicking the block opens a GUI where you can set filters to control which items can pass through the platform.

Items that match the filter will pass through the platform without collision, while other items and entities will slide across it normally. This makes it perfect for creating sophisticated item sorting and transportation systems where you need selective filtering.
