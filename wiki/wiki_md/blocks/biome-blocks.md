# Biome Blocks

## Description

---

All of these Biome Blocks change their color depending on the biome they are in. The Biome Crystals needed to craft them can be found in all dungeon chests.

Biome Stone is a decorative block that automatically changes color to match the biome it is placed in. It comes in several variants including cobblestone, smooth stone, brick, cracked, and chiseled textures. The block's color dynamically updates based on the biome's grass color, making it perfect for creating builds that blend naturally with their environment.

Biome Glass is a translucent glass block that automatically changes color to match the biome it is placed in. Like Biome Stone, it uses the biome's grass color to create a natural, environment-blending appearance. The glass is transparent and can be used for windows, decorative elements, or any build where you want glass that matches the surrounding biome's color scheme.
