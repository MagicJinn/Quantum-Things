# Biome Blocks

## Description

---

All of these Biome Blocks are chameleons - they automatically change their color to match whatever biome you place them in. To craft them, you'll need Biome Crystals, which you can find in dungeon chests scattered throughout the world.

Biome Stone is a decorative block that blends right into its surroundings. It comes in several styles - cobblestone, smooth stone, brick, cracked, and chiseled - but they all share the same magical property: they match the grass color of whatever biome they're in. This makes them perfect for building structures that look like they naturally belong in the environment.

Biome Glass works the same way, but as a see-through block. It's great for windows or decorative elements where you want the glass to match the natural colors around your build. Just like Biome Stone, it automatically picks up the biome's grass color, so your builds will always look cohesive with the landscape.
