# Super Lubricent Platform

## Description

---

The Super Lubricent Platform is a translucent platform block that provides extreme slipperiness. It is only 2 pixels thick (14/16 of a block) and allows entities to slide across it at high speeds while still providing a solid surface to stand on.

Players can sneak on the platform to prevent sliding, making it useful for controlled transportation systems. The platform is ideal for creating fast item transport routes or player movement systems where you need both speed and control.
