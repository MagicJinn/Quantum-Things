# Biome Stone

## Description

---

Biome Stone is a decorative block that automatically changes color to match the biome it is placed in. It comes in several variants including cobblestone, smooth stone, brick, cracked, and chiseled textures.

The block's color dynamically updates based on the biome's grass color, making it perfect for creating builds that blend naturally with their environment. Each variant maintains the same color-matching behavior while offering different visual textures.
