# Bean Pod

## Description

---

The Bean Pod is a block that spawns at the top of a fully grown Magic Bean Stalk. When broken, it drops a variety of valuable resources including beans, iron, gold, diamonds, and emeralds in random quantities.

The pod uses a loot table system to determine its drops, ensuring varied rewards each time. It is the reward for successfully growing a Magic Bean Stalk to its full height and provides a renewable source of valuable materials.
