# Spectre Core

## Description

---

The Spectre Core is an unbreakable block that serves as the foundation for the Spectre dimension. It cannot be destroyed by explosions or entities and is used to expand Spectre Cubes by right-clicking with Ectoplasm. The core automatically adjusts its orientation based on surrounding Spectre Blocks.

When in the Spectre dimension, right-clicking the core with an empty hand teleports you back to the overworld. The core is essential for building and maintaining Spectre Cubes, which provide personal dimensional spaces.
