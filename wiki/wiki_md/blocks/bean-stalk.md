# Bean Stalk

## Description

---

The Bean Stalk is a climbing plant that grows upward when planted from a Magic Bean. There are two types: the standard Bean Stalk, which grows until it hits a block, and the Magic Bean Stalk, which grows all the way to the height limit, breaking any blocks in its path.

Bean Stalks can be climbed like ladders and provide a quick way to reach high places. When a Magic Bean Stalk reaches its maximum height, it spawns a Bean Pod at the top that drops valuable resources including beans, iron, gold, diamonds, and emeralds.
