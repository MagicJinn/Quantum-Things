# Ancient Furnace

## Description

---

The Ancient Furnace is an unbreakable block that serves as part of the Ancient structure system. It cannot be destroyed by explosions or entities and is used in conjunction with Ancient Bricks to create powerful structures.

The furnace is activated by placing a Nether Star in an Ancient Brick above it, which starts the furnace's operation. The exact functionality of the Ancient Furnace depends on the structure it is part of.
