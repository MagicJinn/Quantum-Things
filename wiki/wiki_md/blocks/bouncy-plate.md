# Bouncy Plate

## Description

---

The Bouncy Plate is a thin plate that launches entities upward when they land on it. Entities that come into contact with the plate are given an upward velocity, effectively bouncing them into the air.

The plate resets fall distance and prevents entities from landing normally, instead propelling them upward. This makes it useful for creating vertical transportation systems, item launchers, or fun parkour elements.
