# Directional Accelerator Plate

## Description

---

The Directional Accelerator Plate is a thin plate that accelerates entities in a specific direction. Unlike the standard Accelerator Plate, this version only accelerates entities moving in the configured direction, providing more controlled movement.

The plate has a facing property that determines the acceleration direction. Entities moving in that direction receive a speed boost, while movement in other directions is unaffected. This makes it ideal for creating one-way transportation systems or controlled item routing.
