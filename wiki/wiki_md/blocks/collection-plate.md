# Collection Plate

## Description

---

The Collection Plate is a thin plate that automatically collects items that pass over it and inserts them into adjacent inventories. Items that come into contact with the plate are automatically transferred to connected inventory blocks on the horizontal sides.

The plate checks all four horizontal directions for compatible inventories and inserts items into the first available one. This makes it perfect for automated item collection and sorting systems where you need to gather items from transportation routes.
