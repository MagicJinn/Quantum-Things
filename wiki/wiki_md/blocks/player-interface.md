# Player Interface

## Description

---

The Player Interface is a block that allows you to access the inventory of your player as if it was a chest.

Looking at the block after you placed it down you can see that it has 4 different sides:

| Side | Slots |
|------|-------|
| ![](../images/screenshots_player-interface-1.webp) | Hotbar  |
| ![](../images/screenshots_player-interface-2.webp) | Storage |
| ![](../images/screenshots_player-interface-3.webp) | Armor |
| ![](../images/screenshots_player-interface-4.webp) | Off-hand |

There also is the [Creative Player Interface](creative-player-interface.html) which provides an Open Computers component to set the target player.
