# Imbuing Station

## Description

---

The Imbuing Station is used to create Imbues that give your player on hit effects.

There are currently 4 different imbues available:

| Name             | Effect                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Fire Imbue       | Sets hit enemies on fire for 10 seconds             |
| Poison Imbue     | Applies Poison II to hit enemies for 10 seconds     |
| Experience Imbue | Enemies killed while active drop 50% more experience|
| Wither Imbue     | Applies Wither II to hit enemies for 5 seconds      |

You can only have one imbue active at a time. Drinking another one while one is still active will cancel the first one. All imbues last 20 minutes.
