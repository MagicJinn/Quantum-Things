# Item Rejuvenator Plate

## Description

---

The Item Rejuvenator Plate is a thin plate that resets the despawn timer of items that pass over it. Items that come into contact with the plate have their age reset to the creative despawn time, effectively preventing them from despawning.

This plate is essential for long-distance item transportation systems where items might otherwise despawn before reaching their destination. It ensures that items can travel indefinitely without timing out.
