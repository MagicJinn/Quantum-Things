# Chat Detector

## Description

---

The Chat Detector watches for specific messages in chat and sends out a redstone signal when it finds them. Right-click the block to open its menu where you can type in the exact message you want it to look for. You can also choose how it behaves when it finds a match.

By default, when the Chat Detector spots the message you're looking for, it still lets the message show up in chat for everyone to see. But if you switch it to "consuming" mode, it will hide the message from chat entirely - perfect for secret commands or triggers you don't want others to see.

The standard Chat Detector only watches for messages from the player who placed it. But there's also a Global Chat Detector that listens to everyone on the server. This makes it great for server-wide commands or events. Just keep in mind that if you want to use the consuming mode with the Global Chat Detector, you'll need an ID Card from the player who sent the message to make it work.
