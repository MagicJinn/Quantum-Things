# Redirector Plate

## Description

---

The Redirector Plate is a thin plate that redirects entity movement from an input direction to an output direction. Right-clicking the top of the plate allows you to configure the output direction, while the input direction is set when the plate is placed.

Entities entering from the configured input direction are redirected to the output direction, maintaining their speed but changing their trajectory. This makes it useful for creating controlled transportation routes and item routing systems where you need to change the direction of flow.
