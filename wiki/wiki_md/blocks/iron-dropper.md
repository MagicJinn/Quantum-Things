# Iron Dropper

## Description

---

The Iron Dropper is an advanced configurable Dropper. You can change the pickup delay of items dropped, whether the dropper spits the items out “perfectly straight” (Nice for Superlubricent Ice/Stone), whether there are any particles/sound effects & how it reacts to redstone.
