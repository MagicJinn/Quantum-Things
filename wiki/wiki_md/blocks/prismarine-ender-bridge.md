# Prismarine Ender Bridge

## Description

---

The Prismarine Ender Bridge is an upgraded version of the Ender Bridge that teleports much faster. While the standard Ender Bridge scans 20 blocks per second, the Prismarine Ender Bridge scans 200 blocks per second, making it ten times faster. This means a 100 block distance takes only half a second instead of 5 seconds.

Like the standard Ender Bridge, it requires a clear line of air blocks to an Ender Anchor and will teleport players within a 2 block radius when activated with redstone. The bridge searches for anchors when powered and enters cooldown mode after teleportation until the redstone signal is removed.
