# Super Lubricent Stone

## Description

---

Super Lubricent Stone is a stone block that provides extreme slipperiness, similar to Super Lubricent Ice but with the appearance of stone. Entities will slide across this block at high speeds.

The block combines the durability and appearance of stone with the sliding properties of super lubricent materials, making it useful for transportation systems or builds where you want a stone aesthetic with enhanced movement mechanics.
