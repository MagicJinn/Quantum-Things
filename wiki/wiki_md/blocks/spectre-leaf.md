# Spectre Leaf

## Description

---

The Spectre Leaf is the leaf block from Spectre Trees. When broken, there is a chance it will drop Ectoplasm, making it a renewable source of this valuable material. The leaves have a translucent, ethereal appearance matching other Spectre materials.

Spectre Leaves can be sheared and will naturally decay when the tree structure is broken. They are an important part of farming Ectoplasm, as breaking leaves provides a chance to obtain this resource needed for various Spectre-related crafting recipes.
