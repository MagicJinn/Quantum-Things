# Ender Mailbox

## Description

---

The Ender Mailbox is a personal mailbox that allows players to receive Ender Letters from other players. Each mailbox is owned by the player who places it and can only be accessed by that player. When a mailbox receives a letter, it displays portal particles and becomes active.

To send a letter, a player must right-click a mailbox while sneaking with an addressed Ender Letter. The letter will be delivered to the recipient's mailbox inventory. Mailboxes can store multiple letters and display visual effects when active.
