## Description

The Spectre Log is the log block obtained from Spectre Trees. It can be crafted into Spectre Planks and is used in various Spectre-related recipes. The log maintains the ethereal appearance characteristic of Spectre materials.

Spectre Logs are obtained by breaking Spectre Trees that grow from Spectre Saplings. They are essential for crafting Spectre tools, weapons, and other items that require Spectre materials.
