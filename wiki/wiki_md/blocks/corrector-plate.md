# Corrector Plate

## Description

---

The Corrector Plate is a thin plate that corrects entity movement to align with the primary direction of travel. It centers entities on the plate and removes perpendicular motion, ensuring items and entities move in a straight line.

The plate detects the primary direction of movement (based on which axis has the greater velocity) and centers the entity on that axis while zeroing out motion on the perpendicular axis. This is useful for keeping item streams aligned and preventing drift in transportation systems.
