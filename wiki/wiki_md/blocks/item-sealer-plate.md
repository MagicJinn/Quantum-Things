# Item Sealer Plate

## Description

---

The Item Sealer Plate is a thin plate that prevents items from being picked up for 30 seconds (600 ticks) after they pass over it. Items that come into contact with the plate have their pickup delay set to the maximum, making them temporarily uncollectable.

This plate is useful for item transportation systems where you want items to pass through player areas without being accidentally picked up. It ensures items continue on their automated path even when players are nearby.
