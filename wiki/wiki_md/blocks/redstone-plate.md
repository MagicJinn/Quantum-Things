# Redstone Plate

## Description

---

The Redstone Plate is a thin plate that redirects entity movement based on redstone signals. When powered, it reverses the direction of entities moving across it. When unpowered, you can configure input and output directions by right-clicking the top of the plate.

Entities entering from the configured input direction are redirected to the output direction. The plate becomes powered when it receives a redstone signal, automatically reversing the input/output relationship. This makes it useful for creating redstone-controlled transportation systems.
