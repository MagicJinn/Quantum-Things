# Advanced Item Collector

## Description

---

The Advanced Item Collector is an improved version of the Item Collector with additional features. It can be placed on any side of a block and automatically collects items that come within range, storing them in its internal inventory.

Unlike the basic Item Collector, the Advanced Item Collector has a configurable inventory and can be filtered to only collect specific items. Right-clicking the block opens a GUI where you can configure filters and manage the collected items.
