# Accelerator Plate

## Description

---

The Accelerator Plate is a thin plate that accelerates entities moving across it by 20%. It increases the speed of any entity that passes over it, making it useful for creating fast transportation systems or speeding up item flows.

The acceleration is applied to the entity's current motion vector, with a maximum speed cap to prevent excessive velocities. The plate works in all directions, accelerating entities regardless of which way they're moving.
