# Ancient Brick

## Description

---

The Ancient Brick is an unbreakable decorative block that comes in several variants: runes, default, star empty, star full, and output. It cannot be destroyed by explosions or entities and is used to construct Ancient structures.

Placing a Nether Star in a star empty variant converts it to star full and activates any Ancient Furnace below it. The bricks automatically melt snow that falls on them and are essential components of Ancient structure systems.
