# Biome Glass

## Description

---

Biome Glass is a translucent glass block that automatically changes color to match the biome it is placed in. Like Biome Stone, it uses the biome's grass color to create a natural, environment-blending appearance.

The glass is transparent and can be used for windows, decorative elements, or any build where you want glass that matches the surrounding biome's color scheme. The color updates automatically when the block is placed in different biomes.
