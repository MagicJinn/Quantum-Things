# Slime Cube

## Description

---

Slime Cubes allow Slimes to spawn in the Chunk they are in. Unlike Vanilla Slime Chunks Slimes can spawn at any height & do so at a significantly increased rate.
Powered by Redstone this block instead prevents slimes from spawning through vanilla spawning mechanics (Slime Chunk / Swampland)
