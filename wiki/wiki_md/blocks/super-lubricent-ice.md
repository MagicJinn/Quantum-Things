# Super Lubricent Ice

## Description

---

Super Lubricent Ice is a special ice block that provides extreme slipperiness, making entities slide across it at high speeds. It is translucent like regular ice but offers enhanced movement properties.

The block is useful for creating fast transportation systems, item sorting mechanisms, or any build where you need entities to move quickly across a surface. It maintains the visual properties of ice while providing superior sliding mechanics.
