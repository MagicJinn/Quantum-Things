# Glowing Mushroom

## Description

---

The Glowing Mushroom is a luminous mushroom that emits light and can be planted on various surfaces. It naturally spreads to nearby valid locations and requires low light levels to grow, making it ideal for cave environments.

The mushroom can be planted on grass, dirt, stone, or Fertilized Dirt, and will slowly spread to adjacent blocks over time. It provides both decorative lighting and can be harvested for use in crafting or as a light source.
