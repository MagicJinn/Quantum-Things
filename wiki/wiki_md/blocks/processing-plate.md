# Processing Plate

## Description

---

The Processing Plate is a thin plate that processes items by inserting them into the inventory below and redirecting entities in a configured direction. Right-clicking opens a GUI to configure processing settings, and shift-right-clicking the top reverses the output direction.

The plate attempts to insert items into the block below it, and any items that can't be inserted are redirected in the configured output direction. This makes it ideal for automated crafting or processing systems where items need to be fed into machines and excess items need to be routed elsewhere.
