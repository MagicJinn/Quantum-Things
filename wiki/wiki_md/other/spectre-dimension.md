# Spectre Dimension

## Description

---

The Spectre Dimension is your own personal pocket dimension that you can access from anywhere using a Spectre Key. Think of it as your own private room that follows you wherever you go. When you first step inside, you'll find yourself in a cozy space that's 16 blocks wide, 16 blocks deep, and 4 blocks tall. Right in the center sits the Spectre Core, the heart of your dimensional space.

Want more room? Just right-click the Spectre Core with Ectoplasm to make your space taller. Each Ectoplasm adds one block of height, so if you collect enough, you can build your dimension all the way up to the world's height limit. The core is smart too - it automatically adjusts how it looks based on the Spectre Blocks you place around it.

Spectre Blocks are see-through, unbreakable blocks perfect for building the walls and structure of your Spectre Cube. They work hand-in-hand with the Spectre Core to create your personal space. Best of all, nothing can destroy these blocks - not explosions, not mobs, nothing. This makes your dimension the perfect safe storage spot for your most valuable items.

If you want to set up machines or other devices that need power, you can place a Spectre Energy Injector in your dimension. This special block helps manage energy for whatever contraptions you dream up in your personal space.

The best part? You can build whatever you want in here - storage rooms, farms, workshops, or just a place to relax. Everything you create is accessible from anywhere in the world just by using your Spectre Key. And don't worry about privacy - your dimension is completely yours. Other players can't get in unless they're in creative mode.

To head back to the regular world, just use your Spectre Key again, or right-click the Spectre Core with an empty hand.
