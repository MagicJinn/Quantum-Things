# Ancient Furnace

## Description

---

You can rarely find Ancient Furnaces in cold biomes. Right clicking the opening on the top with a nether star will activate it, after heating up it will turn an area of 10000 blocks (configurable) around it into a warmer biome removing any surface snow in the process. It will explode once it’s done.
