# Ancient Furnace

## Description

---

You can rarely find Ancient Furnaces in cold biomes. The furnace is constructed using Ancient Bricks, which come in several variants: runes, default, star empty, star full, and output. Ancient Bricks are unbreakable blocks that cannot be destroyed by explosions or entities, and they automatically melt snow that falls on them.

Right clicking an Ancient Brick with a star empty variant using a Nether Star will convert it to star full and activate any Ancient Furnace below it. After heating up, the furnace will turn an area of 10000 blocks (configurable) around it into a warmer biome, removing any surface snow in the process. It will explode once it's done.
