# Ancient Furnace

## Description

---

You can rarely find Ancient Furnaces in cold biomes. Right clicking the opening on the top with a nether star will activate it, after heating up it will turn an area of 10000 blocks (configurable) around it into a warmer biome removing any surface snow in the process. It will explode once it’s done.

The Ancient Furnace can be configured to drop its item forms when broken, allowing you to remove them, use them as decoration, or rebuild them elsewhere. Disabled by default.
