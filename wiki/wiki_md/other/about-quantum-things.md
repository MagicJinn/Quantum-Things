# About Quantum Things

## What is Quantum Things?

Quantum Things is a 1.12.2 continuation of Lumien231's [Random Things](https://github.com/lumien231/Random-Things). The mod maintains the original design philosophy while providing continued support, bug fixes, and new features.

## About Random Things

Random Things is a miscellaneous mod that adds a diverse collection of utility items, blocks, and gameplay enhancements. It includes features such as:

- Automated item collection
- Crop growth acceleration with Fertilized Dirt
- A personal pocket dimension called the Spectre Dimension
- Spectre Coils for wireless energy transfer
- Divining Rods for locating ores
- Various redstone utilities
- Decorative blocks
- Numerous quality-of-life improvements

The mod is designed to complement other mods by adding convenience features and new gameplay without adhering to a specific theme. As Lumien put it:

> Random Things is a collection of features that i thought would be neat. The mod doesn't really have a central topic so it's best played alongside other mods.

## Quantum Things Goals

The goal of Quantum Things is to provide continued support for Random Things, including:

- New features and enhancements
- Bug and crash fixes
- Compatibility improvements with other mods
- Configuration options
- Maintaining the original design goal and intent of the mod

## Credits

**The majority of the credit goes to Lumien231**, who created the absolutely monolithic Random Things (MIT).

**Additional credit goes to UniversalTweaks (MIT)** for 3 of the bug fixes.
